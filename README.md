This shiny app estimates stock-specific CAPM alphas and betas for your favorit stocks from selected market indexes. 

This app is a prototype based on the book [Tidy Finance with R](https://www.tidy-finance.org/) and a submission for the [2024 Shiny Contest](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2024-shiny-contest/) by Posit.

You can find the app on [shinyapps.io](https://christophscheuch.shinyapps.io/app-alpha-estimator/) and the source on [Github](https://github.com/tidy-intelligence/app-alpha-estimator).
